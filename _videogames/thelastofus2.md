When the sequel to the critically acclaimed 'The Last of Us' was announced at PSX 2016, many fans were excited but
some were skeptical. The first game had ended the story of Joel and Ellie (the two main characters) in a fulfilling (but controversial) way.
They were to live the rest of their lives in Jackson County, Wyoming with the decision that Joel that made at the end of the first game.
So why did Naughty Dog decide to make a sequel to The Last of Us? Is there more to the story of Joel and Ellie? Does the sequel to one of the
best games of the last generation justify it's existence? In my opinion, the sequel not only justifies its existence but it is also one of the
best games I've played this year. It is truly a game that defines this generation; a swansong for the PlayStation 4.

### Synopsis


The story of the first game revolved around the themes of love and hope in a bleak world that is torn apart by a deadly virus that infects people
and turns them into mushroom zombies. While this premise may sound outrageous (and hilarious), the Cordyceps virus actually exists in the real world
and it takes over the motor functions of insects (especially ants). ![image-left](/images/tlou2_review_image_2.jpg){: .align-left} The sequel, however, mirrors those themes. It is a game is about hate and loss.
You play as Ellie this time who faces a traumatic event in her life and sets out to make things right. She wants to take revenge for what has happened
to her. Revenge stories are nothing new and this one isn't particularly new either. However, the way Naughty Dog tells the story, that is where the game
shines. The game puts in a situation that you feel is necessary for the time but then a few hours later, makes you question that decision. You will start
questioning the characters you loved, and maybe empathize with characters that you initially dislike. There will come a time in the game where you fight
a boss but you're rooting for the boss but also yourself. It's confusing, messy and manipulative - *I love it*.

### Gameplay

The gameplay of The Last of Us Part II isn't something that you haven't seen before. Fans of the previous game will feel right at home. However, it is
refined to the maximum degree. The game was delayed multiple times by the studio citing the reason that it requires the *Naughty Dog polish* and I must agree, it
is one of the most polished games I have ever played. The level design is clear and intuitive, I always knew where I had to go with no markers on the screen but it felt as though
I was exploring organically.
