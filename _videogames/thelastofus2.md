When the sequel to the critically acclaimed 'The Last of Us' was announced at PSX 2016, many fans were excited but
some were skeptical. The first game had ended the story of Joel and Ellie (the two main characters) in a fulfilling (but controversial) way.
They were to live the rest of their lives in Jackson County, Wyoming with the decision that Joel that made at the end of the first game.
So why did Naughty Dog decide to make a sequel to The Last of Us? Is there more to the story of Joel and Ellie? Does the sequel to one of the
best games of the last generation justify it's existence? In my opinion, the sequel not only justifies its existence but it is also one of the
best games I've played this year. It is truly a game that defines this generation; a swansong for the PlayStation 4.

### Synopsis


The story of the first game revolved around the themes of love and hope in a bleak world that is torn apart by a deadly virus that infects people
and turns them into mushroom zombies. While this premise may sound outrageous (and hilarious), the Cordyceps virus actually exists in the real world
and it takes over the motor functions of insects (especially ants). The sequel, however, mirrors those themes. It is a game is about hate and loss.
You play as Ellie this time who faces a traumatic event in her life and sets out to make things right.

She wants to take revenge for what has happened to her. Revenge stories are nothing new in contemporary media and this one isn't particularly new either. However, the way Naughty Dog tells the story, that is
where the game shines. The game puts in a situation and makes a decision that you feel is necessary for the time but then a few hours later, makes you question that decision. Actions that you feel were right will
turn out to be wrong. Actions that you feel are wrong may not be as wrong as you thought early on. You will start questioning the characters you loved, and maybe empathize with characters that you initially dislike. There will come a time in the game where you fight a boss and you'll  end  up rooting for the boss but also yourself (or may be not). It's confusing, messy and manipulative - *I love it*.

### Gameplay

The gameplay of The Last of Us Part II isn't something that you haven't seen before. Fans of the previous game will feel right at home. However, it is
refined to the maximum degree. The game was delayed multiple times by the studio citing the reason that it requires the *Naughty Dog polish* and I must agree, it
is one of the most polished games I have ever played. The level design is clear and intuitive, I always knew where I had to go with no markers on the screen but it felt as though
I was exploring organically. A large part of the game takes place in Seattle and it is huge but never overwhelming. They do a fantastic job of letting you explore the open sections at your own
pace without hurting the story progression of the game.

The stealth reminded of Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear Solid V which in my opinion, is the perfect stealth simulator. Whether you are sneaking past the infected or are fighting the varied human
enemies, the tension is always high. Even if you get detected, it is always a good idea to run far away from the area and go back into stealth. Furthermore, the stealth gameplay isn't always
the same. The player has to adapt to their environment and enemies. The infected may have specific patterns that you can sneak past, but the humans do not. They have unpredictable behaviors which raises
the tension even more. An example would be that if they find a body, they don't just go back to normal after some time. They start doing a grid search and looking for suspicious activity in the area.

The game also does a great job of mixing the themes of the story with it's gameplay. In most games, you kill hundreds of NPCs without feeling any remorse. In this game, however, every NPC is named and
behaves like an actual human being. Two NPCs who cross paths may start a conversation. They talk to each other and try to flank the player during combat. If they find a body, they express sadness and call out the name of
that NPC. When I heard the name of the people I killed, it made them human to me which I have not seen in any other game. Killing an NPC has weight to it in this game. It's a simple touch but quite effective.

The only part of the gameplay that let me down was the character customization. The skill-tree in the game isn't really a skill tree, they are skill-lines which you unlock one by one by collecting pills. They can large
be ignored and the game will still play the game. Furthermore, the weapon customization faces this same problem. You collect parts to upgrade your weapons but it lacks depth. You can add a scope or decrease the reload
time but that's as far as it goes. However, this is a minor complaint in a game that otherwise plays fantastic.
