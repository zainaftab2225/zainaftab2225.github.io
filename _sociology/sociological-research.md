### Research Model

- Scientific research follows **eight** basic steps. They are explained below.

#### 1. Selecting a Topic

- The first step is to select a topic that a sociologist finds interesting e.g. homelessness, poverty, gender equality in an organization, etc.
- Some sociologists choose a topic because they want to better understand a social problem and may be even solve it.

#### 2. Defining the Problem

- The second step is to define the problem, to specify what sociologists want to learn about the topic.
- Homelessness is a vague problem that is common around the globe. Sociologists may examine *specific* aspects of homelessness e.g. how homeless people survive on the streets or how homeless people's diet compares with others, etc.

#### 3. Reviewing the Literature

- Sociologists must read what has been published on their topic.
- They need to narrow the problem, identify known areas and decide which area needs to be researched.
- Sociologists might even find out that the question they are interested in may have been answered already so they don't need to rediscover what is already known.

#### 4. Formulating a Hypothesis

- The fourth step is to formulate a **hypothesis**, a statement of what sociologists expect to find according to predictions from a theory.
- “Men who are more socially isolated are likelier to abuse their wives than men who are more socially integrated” is an example hypothesis.
- A hypothesis predicts a relationship between or among **variables** e.g. variables in the above hypothesis could be *social isolation*, *social integration* and *spouse abuse*.
- These variables need to be precisely defined so they can be measured; we call these definitions of variables **operational definitions**.

#### 5. Choosing a Research Method

- Sociologists then need to decide how they are going to collect the data. Sociologists use seven basic research methods (or research designs).
- They choose the method that will best answer the particular questions they are asking.
- Most importantly they want to figure out the averages of a research so they can see whether their theory holds up with the statistical data.

#### 6. Collecting the Data

- When collecting data, sociologists have to take care to assure the data is **valid** and **reliable**.
- **Validity**: operational definitions must measure what they are intended to measure. Spouse abuse is a *vague* term. It needs to be defined in detail so no one has any question what the sociologist's operational definition is for spouse abuse.
- **Reliability**: if other researchers use a sociologist's operational definitions, their findings will be consistent with the sociologist's findings. For example, you show a 10 percent rate of spouse abuse, but another researcher using the same operational definitions determines it to be 30 percent, the research is unreliable.

#### 7. Analyzing the Results

- Sociologists will have been trained in a variety of techniques to analyze the collected data — from those that apply to observations of people in small settings to the analysis of large-scale surveys.
- If a sociologist has a hypothesis in their research, now is when they will test it.

#### 8. Sharing the Results

- To wrap up their research, sociologists will write a report to share their findings with the scientific community.
- They will state their methodology, their operational definitions, comparisons with other reports and whether they agree with the theories of others.


### Research Methods (Designs)

- Let’s look in greater detail at the **fifth** step to see what research methods sociologists use.

#### Surveys

- **Survey**: the collection of data by having a *population* answer a series of questions e.g. wives that are in an abused in the relationship will answer the questions.
- **Population**: a target group to be studied e.g. the wives.
- **Sample**: a representation of the population e.g. it is impossible to survey all the wives in the world, so we require a *representative sample*. The best way is to use a *random sample*.
- **Random Sample**: everyone in your population (the target group) has the same chance of being included in the study. A random sample will represent the target population fairly and will allow generalizations.
- Researchers need to establish **rapport**, a feeling of trust, with their respondents, especially when it comes to sensitive topics. Anonymous surveys also help in this regard.
- Sociologists need to make sure that the questions are **neutral** in their surveys e.g. the question, “don’t you think that men who beat their wives should go to prison?” is subtly tilting the respondent to favor prison for abusers.
- In surveys, you can have open-ended or close-ended questions.
  - **Open-ended questions** allow the respondents to share their full opinion but are hard to compare.
  - **Close-ended questions** are easy to compare in the study but the opinions of respondents may be lacking.
-

#### Observation (Fieldwork)

- **Participant observation**: the researcher participates in a research setting while observing what is happening in that setting.
- However, some issues you can't just sit around and observe e.g. abusive relationships. Sociologists face the dilemma: How involved should you get in the lives of the people you are observing?

#### Case Studies

- To do a **case study**, the researcher focuses on a single event, situation, or individual.
- The purpose is to understand the dynamics of relationships and power, or even the thinking that motivates people.
-  For spouse abuse, a case study would focus on a single wife and husband, exploring the couple’s history and relationship.
- However, case studies are specific and it is hard to generalize from them.

#### Secondary Analysis

- If you were to analyze data that someone else has already collected, you would be doing **secondary analysis**.
- For example, if you were to examine the original data from a study of women who had been abused by their husbands, you would be doing secondary analysis.

#### Analysis of Documents

- The fifth method that sociologists use is the study of **documents**, recorded sources.
- To investigate social life, they examine such diverse sources as books, newspapers, diaries, bank records, police reports, immigration files, and records kept by organizations.
- The term documents is broad and also includes *video* and *audio* recordings.

#### Experiments

- **Experiment**: the use of control and experimental groups and dependent and independent variables to test *causation*.
- **Experimental Group**: the group of subjects in an experiment who are exposed to the independent variable.
- **Control Group**: the subjects in an experiment who are not exposed to the independent variable.
- **Independent Variable**: a factor that causes a change in another variable, called the dependent variable.
- **Dependent Variable**: a factor in an experiment that is changed by an independent variable.
- **Causation**: means that a change in one variable is caused by another variable. Three conditions are necessary for causation:
  - correlation: two variables that exist together.
  - temporal priority: one variable takes place before the second.
  - spurious correlation: two variables that exist together may not be correlated. There might be a third hidden variable.
- As an example, lets *experiment* with a group of abusers to see if therapy works on them. Divide the group into two parts: one that gets therapy *(experimental group)* and one that doesn't *(control group)*. Therapy will be our independent variable because it may affect their behavior *(dependent variable)*. If the wives report better behavior after therapy, you can conclude that the therapy worked and vice versa.

#### Unobtrusive Measures

- In our technological society, we are surrounded by **unobtrusive measures**, ways to observe people who are not aware that they are being studied. The face-recognition cameras, tracking services, and coupons, which raise ethical issues of invasion of privacy, are part of marketing, **not** sociological research.
-  The unobtrusive measures used by sociologists are relatively primitive e.g. counting number of empty whisky bottles to gauge alcohol consumption.
- **Ethical Principle**: To record the behavior of people in public settings, such as a crowd, without announcing that you are doing so is acceptable. To do this in private settings is not.

### Gender in Sociological Research

- Gender certainly can be an impediment in research.
- There are certain cases such as the abuse example where abused women might respond better to women researchers than men. That's because they were abused by men.
- In the same way, men may open up more about their personal lives with a male researcher as compared to a female.

### Ethics in Sociological Research

- Research ethics requires:
  - honesty
  - truth
  - openness
  - no falsification of results
  - no plagiarism
  - informed respondents
  - anonymity of those who provide information
- Humphrey's Tearoom Example: sociologist disguised himself as a *watch queen* to look at people in bathroom stalls.

### How *NOT* to Do Research

1. Choose a biased sample.
2. Ask biased questions.
3. List biased choices.
4. Discard undesirable results.
5. Misunderstand the subjects’ world.
6. Analyze the data incorrectly.
