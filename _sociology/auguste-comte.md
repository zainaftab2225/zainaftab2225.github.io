### Introduction

Auguste Comte (1798-1857) is known as the founder of sociology because he suggested to apply the scientific method, **positivism**, to study the social world. He coined the term 'Sociology' from the Greek word *logos* (study of) and the Latin word *socius* (being with others) in 1838.

Whereas previous thinkers dating back to ancient Greece were more interested in an ideal society and how humanity might go about achieving it, Comte's major objective was to understand how the contemporary society actually operates.

### Law of Three Stages

Comte believed that the science of sociology developed over three stages in history:
1. Theological Stage
2. Metaphysical Stage
3. Positivism

#### Stage 1: Theological Stage

The theological stage lasted from the beginning of human history to the end of the European Middle Ages around 1350 CE. The theological stage consists of religious and supernatural explanations of how society is formed. It talks about how society exists only because of God's will. In this stage, everything from religion is accepted without any questioning or doubts.

#### Stage 2: Metaphysical Stage

The metaphysical stage consists of the renaissance of Europe in the 15th century. People started seeing society as a natural concept as compared to the theological stage where they saw society as a supernatural concept. People observed their surroundings, wrote down their findings and debated on it. People moved away from religious beliefs and started to go towards a more scientific approach of question. The metaphysical stage did not apply the actual scientific method where conclusions are based on empirical evidence, rather it was a *transitioning* stage.

Important contributors to the metaphysical stage were:
- **Hobbes** who worked on the social contract theory;
- **Locke** who stated that human beings have inalienable rights which also inspired the declaration of the independence of USA;
- **Rousseau** who also worked on the social contract theory.

#### Stage 3: Positivism

The positivism stage began with the early work of scientists like Copernicus, Galileo and Issac Newton. Comte argued that this is the final stage that uses scientific experimentation, observation and measurement. Nothing is believed in this stage unless there is hard empirical evidence.

Comte believed that society operates according to its own laws, just like the physical world and it can be understand through positivism.
