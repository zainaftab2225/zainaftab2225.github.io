### Introduction

Auguste Comte (1798-1857) is known as the founder of sociology because he suggested to apply the scientific method, **positivism**, to study the social world. He coined the term 'Sociology' from the Greek word *logos* (study of) and the Latin word *socius* (being with others) in 1838.

Whereas previous thinkers dating back to ancient Greece were more interested in an ideal society and how humanity might go about achieving it, Comte's major objective was to understand how the contemporary society actually operates.

Comte believed that the science of sociology developed over three stages in history:
1. Theological Stage
2. Metaphysical Stage
3. Positivism
