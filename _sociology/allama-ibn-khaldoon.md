### Introduction

- Ibn-i-Khaldoon was an Arab scholar and social scientist of the Middle Ages.
- One of his famous works, the *Muqaddimah*, influenced Ottoman historians who used Khaldoon's theories to analyze the growth and decline of the Ottoman Empire.
- His most famous work is **Ilmul-Imran** which later turned into **Imraniyat** (Sociology). The thoughts left behind by him are called **Khaldooniyat**.
- His theories are evolutionary in nature.

### Scientific Methodology

- Ibn-i-Khaldoon talked about applying logic and scientific method to study social sciences.
- He was of the opinion that history is opinionated so it should be looked at through a scientific lens.

### Theory of Al-Asabiya (Social Solidarity)

- **Al-Asabiya** is the force that unites people according to Khaldoon.
- This *Unity* or *Solidarity* is based on shared common experiences and emotions. In other words, people with similar experiences tend to form tight groups and stay united.
- This sense of unity is strong enough to drive people together to form tribes and then societies.
- Al-Asabiya is strongest when people depend on each other for their livelihood, like in Nomadic tribes.
- This interdependence and desire to satisfy mutual needs results in **Urbanization** and formation of a **Civilization**.
- Civilization is just an organized way for people to co-operate since it includes a system of **justice**. People don't have to use force with each other to have their needs fulfilled and can instead look to a higher authority.
- Khaldoon also stated that no movement in religion can succeed without Al-Asabiya.
- Al-Asabiya can be weakened by:
  - subjugation(slavery).
  - humiliation.
  - luxury as time passes.

### Theory of Rural and Urban Society

- Society is divided into two types: **Urban (Hazri)** and **Rural (Badvi)**.
- Rural society has a strong force of Al-Asabiya as compared to the urban society. This is because rural people need to depend on each other much more to survive as compared to the luxuries of an urban society.
- Al-Asabiya is weak in urban societies where people live in luxury without fear for their life.

### Theory of Social Change

- Human society is ever changing and the cause of this change is solidarity.
- Societies which lose the power of solidarity become disorganized which results in change and problems.
- It becomes disorganized and a different society which has a stronger force of Al-Asabiya takes its place.
- Described 3 principles of social change:
  1. Physical boundary of states should be limited because it is impossible to control large states.
  2. Physical age of a state is 120 years in 3 equal stages of 40 years each.
  3. Rise and fall of nations is in cycles, when one nation falls: another nation rises to replace it.
