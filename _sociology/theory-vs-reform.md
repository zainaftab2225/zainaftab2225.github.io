### Introduction

- By the 1940s, the application of sociology had shifted from social reform to social theory.
- Talcott Parsons was an advocate of social theory and developed abstract models of society.
- C. Wright Mills, another sociologist, thought sociologists should focus on social reform. His ideas became popular in 1970s when activism in America was at its peak.

### Basic Sociology

- **Basic Sociology**: sociological research for the purpose of making discoveries about life in human groups, not for making changes in those groups.
- Some sociologists see their proper role as doing **basic (or pure) sociology**, analyzing some aspect of society with no goal other than gaining knowledge.


### Applied Sociology

- **Applied Sociology**: the use of sociology to solve problems — from the micro level of classroom interaction and family relationships to the macro level of crime and pollution.
- Others reply, "knowledge for what?"  They argue that gaining knowledge through research is not enough and sociologists need to help reform society, especially to bring justice and help the poor.
- In modern times, sociologists apply sociology to solve social problems like issues in the workplace, rape, pollution, spread of AIDS, terrorism and negative impacts of industrialization.

### Public Sociology

- **Public Sociology**: applying sociology for the public good; especially the use of the sociological perspective (how things are related to one another) to guide politicians and policy makers.
- Public sociology is a **middle ground** between research and reform.
- One of the most important aspects of public sociology is to make policy makers *understand* the society so they develop policies in a pragmatic manner.
