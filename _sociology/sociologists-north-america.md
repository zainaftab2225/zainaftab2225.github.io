*"Sexism, Racism and Sociology in North America"*

### Female Sociologists

- Sex roles were rigid in the 1800 leading to very few female sociologists.
- Females were expected to stick to the four C's: **church**, **cooking**, **children** and **clothes**.
- Most early female sociologists, who managed to study, viewed sociology as a path to social reform.

#### Harriet Martineau (1802–1876)

- Martineau was a sociologist from England who did extensive analysis of US social customs.
-  Sexism was so pervasive that when Martineau first began to analyze social life, she would hide her
writing beneath her sewing when visitors arrived.
- Until recently, Martineau was known primarily for translating Comte’s ideas into English.

#### Jane Addams (1860–1935)

- Jane Addams was a prominent sociologist and social reformer who became one of the founding members of the **American Sociological Society**.
- On a trip to Europe, she saw the work being done for the poor and decided to work for social justice.
- She campaigned for 8-hour work days and for laws against child labor.
- She wrote books on poverty, democracy and peace which made her win a **Nobel Prize for Peace**.

### Racism and W. E. B. Du Bois

- Racism was prevalent in the 19th and 20th century in North America.
- W(illiam) E(dward) B(urghardt) Du Bois (1868–1963) was a black man who was graduate of Fisk University, Harvard and University of Berlin.
- He spent his lifetime studying relations between African Americans and whites.
- Du Bois combined the role of academic sociologist with that of social reformer.
- Du Bois was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
- At age 93, dismayed that so little improvement had been made in race relations, he moved to Ghana, where he was buried.
