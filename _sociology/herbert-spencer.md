*"The great aim of education is not knowledge but action."*

### Summary
### Introduction

Spencer was born in England (1820-1903 and is known as the second founder of sociology. Spencer was also a *structural functionalist* but also advocated the *evolutionary theory*. While Comte had actively participated to change society by introducing a religion, Spencer believed sociologists should not guide social reform. He believed that it would interfere with the natural process of evolution of a society. Spencer coined the term "survival of the fittest". He did armchair philosophy (like Comte) instead of conducting scientific research.

### Theory of Evolution

According to Spencer, every society evolves from:
- simple --> complex;
- homogeneous --> heterogeneous.

Spencer divided evolution into two categories:
1. simplicity --> complexity;
2. militant society --> industrial society.

#### 1. Simple to Complex Evolution

Spencer said that there are 4 stages to evolution:
1. **Simple society** is the most basic society made up of the family unit;
2. **Compound society** is a large number of simple societies that form a *clan*;
3. **Doubly Compound society** is a large number of compound societies or colans that come together to form a *tribe*;
4. **Trebly Compound society** is made up of a large number of tribes that come together to form a *nation state*.

#### 2. Militant to Industrial Evolution

In **militant societies**, units are forced to cooperat and obey the commands of the superior officer. Militant societies have a centralized government structure which dominates over the organizations of the society.

In contrast, **industrial societies** have voluntary cooperation with a democratic and devolved government structure. The state plays very little role in an industrial society.

| Militant Society | Industrial Society |
|------- | ---------|
| Defensive/Offensive | Peaceful |
| Compulsory cooperation | Voluntary cooperation |
| State over individual | Individual over state |
| Public organizations | Individual over state |
| Centralized state | Individual over state |
| Protectionism | Individual over state |
| Economic autonomy | Individual over state |
| State over individual | Individual over state |
| State over individual | Individual over state |
