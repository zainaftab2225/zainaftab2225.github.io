### Introduction

- **Culture**: the language, beliefs, values, norms, behaviors, and even material objects that characterize a group's **way of life** and are passed from one generation to the next.
- An example would be a young Pakistan girl who went to the US. Her culture will be different than the Americans. She'll dress differently, think differently, eat differently, etc.

### Types of Culture

#### 1. Material Culture

- **Material Culture**: the material objects that distinguish a group of people, such as their art, buildings, weapons, utensils, machines, hairstyles, clothing, and jewelry.
- There is nothing “natural” about material culture. Arabs wear gowns on the street and feel that it is natural to do so. Americans do the same with jeans.

#### 2. Non-material Culture

- **Non-material Culture**: a group’s ways of thinking (including its beliefs, values, and other assumptions about the world) and doing (its common patterns of behavior, including language and other forms of interaction); also called *symbolic culture*.
-  There is nothing “natural” about nonmaterial culture. It is just as arbitrary to stand in line as to push and shove.

### Elements of Symbolic Culture

- Sociologists often refer to nonmaterial culture as symbolic culture, because it consists of the symbols that people use.
- A symbol is something to which people attach meaning and that they use to communicate with one another.
- Symbols include gestures, language, beliefs, values, norms, customs and sanctions.

#### 1. Gestures

- **Gestures**: the ways in which people use their bodies to communicate with one another.
- Gestures can lead to misunderstanding, embarrassment, or worse because they differ around the world e.g. handshaking is a greeting gesture in the US whereas bowing down is a greeting gesture in Japan. This may create confusion on how to greet the other person depending on their culture.
- Although most gestures are learned, and therefore vary from culture to culture, some gestures that represent fundamental emotions such as sadness, anger, and fear appear to be inborn.
- A crying child in India differs little from a crying child in China — or the United States or anywhere else on the globe. In a few years, however, the child will demonstrate a variety of gestures highly specific to his Hindu culture.

#### 2. Language

- **Language**: a system of symbols that can be combined in an infinite number of ways and can represent not only objects but also abstract thought.
- Like gestures, in different cultures the same sound may mean something entirely different — or may have no meaning at all e.g. gift in English means poison in German. If you give chocolates to a German and say, "gift, eat..", you'll be telling a German person to eat poison.
- **Functions of Language**
  1. By means of language, we pass ideas, knowledge, and even attitudes on to the next generation.
  2. By attaching words to an event and then using those words to recall it, we are able to discuss the event. In other words, no language means no memories.
  3. Language enables us to agree on times, dates, and places. Concept of time would not exist without language.
  4. Language allows shared perspectives by communication.
  5. Language allows shared, goal-directed behavior.
- **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis**: Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf’s hypothesis that language creates ways of thinking and perceiving. Language isn't just for expressing our thoughts, they claimed, but they also *shaped* our thoughts. In Urdu, you may call a club sandwich or a Subway sandwich as just a sandwich but for English speakers, subs and sandwiches are different. Jam and jelly is same for people who speak Urdu but quite different for native English speakers.

#### 3. Beliefs
#### 4. Values

- **Values**: the standards by which people define what is desirable or undesirable, good or bad, beautiful or ugly.
- As an example, the US society has these core values: achievement, individualism, material comfort, hard work, equality, and group superiority (even though it is contradictory to equality).
- **Value Cluster**: values that together form a larger whole. Values are not independent units; some cluster together to form a larger whole e.g. achievement, hard work and material comfort all come under the value of *success* in life which is a value cluster.
- **Value Contradictions**: values that contradict one another; to follow the one means to come into conflict with the other e.g. equality and group superiority.


#### 5. Norms
#### 6. Customs
#### 7. Sanctions

### Ideal versus Real Culture

- Many of the norms that surround cultural values are followed only partially.
- **Ideal Culture**: culture a people’s ideal values and norms; the goals held out for them e.g. we want to ideal Muslims by following Islamic principles to the tee.
- **Real Culture**: the norms and values that people actually follow; as opposed to ideal culture e.g. what we actually practice as Muslims which may not be ideal such as crime even in Muslim societies.


### Cultural Shock

- Anthropologist Ralph Linton (1936) said, “the last thing a fish would ever notice would be water.” So also with people: Except in unusual circumstances, most characteristics of our own culture remain imperceptible to us.
- We came into this life without a language; without values and morality; with no ideas about religion, war, money, love, use of space, and so on. Yet by this point in our lives, we all have acquired them—and take them for granted. Sociologists call this **culture within us**.
-  *This taken for granted culture becomes the lens through which we perceive and evaluate what is going on around us.*
- The rare instances in which these assumptions are challenged, however, can be upsetting and may result in a *culture shock*.
- **Culture Shock**: the disorientation that people experience when they come in contact with a fundamentally different culture and can no longer depend on their taken-for granted assumptions about life.

### Ethnocentrism

- Sociologist William Sumner (1906) said, “One’s own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.”
- An important consequence of culture within us is ethnocentrism.
- **Ethnocentrism**: a tendency to use our own group’s ways of doing things as a yardstick for judging other individuals or societies, generally leading to a *negative* evaluation of their values, norms and beliefs.
- Ethnocentrism has both positive and negative consequences:
  - **Positive**: it creates in-group loyalties. You may care more for a stranger that shares the same ethnicity as your own.
  - **Negative**: ethnocentrism can lead to discrimination against people whose ways differ from ours. Black people were regarded as savages by the *civilized* white Americans in the past.

### Xenocentrism

- **Xenocentrism***: preference for the products, style, culture, people, significant others, and food of others, rather than of one's own.
- An exchange student who goes home after a semester abroad or a sociologist who returns from the field may find it difficult to associate with the values of their own culture after having experienced what they deem a more upright or nobler way of living.

### Cultural Relativism

- To counter this notion of ethnocentrism, we can practice cultural relativism.
- **Cultural Relativism**: not judging a culture but trying to understand it on its own terms.
- Examples:
  1. Bullfighting is barbaric to Americans but to Spaniards, it is a display of courage, glory and competition between the bull and the matador.
  2. Satti was an ancient Hindu practice where the wife was burned with the husband when he died. It may seem cruel and evil to the rest of the world, but to the Hindu community, Satti symbolized closure to a marriage. It was a voluntary act in which, as a sign of being a dutiful wife, a woman followed her husband to the afterlife. Ibn-I-Battuta had a cultural shock and almost fainted when he heard the screaming women.
- Although cultural relativism helps us avoid cultural smugness, this view has come under attack. Anthropologist Robert Edgerton suggests that a scale should be developed to measure the "quality of life" of different cultures. Cultures that result in exploitation and violence (gang rape, wife beating, child prostitution, etc.) should not be acceptable even if viewed through the lens of cultural relativism.

### Cultural Imperialism

- People with the best intentions sometimes travel to a society to “help” its people, because they see them as uneducated or backward—essentially inferior. In reality, these travelers are guilty of cultural imperialism.
- **Cultural Imperialism**: the deliberate imposition of one’s own cultural values on another culture.
- European colonizers often viewed the people in the lands they colonized as uncultured savages who were in need of European governance, dress, religion, and other cultural practices.

### Cultural Universalism

- Although there are universal human activities (singing, playing games, storytelling, preparing food, marrying, child rearing, disposing of the dead, and so on), there is no universal way of doing any of them.
- **Cultural Universalism**: a value, norm, or other cultural trait that is found in every group.


### Culture vs. Biology

- Edward Wilson set off a debate when he said that human behavior and their way of living isn't determined by culture but by genetics. Competition, cooperation, altruism, envy - even religion, war and peace - could be explained by **sociobiology**, claimed Wilson.
- Sociologists disagree with this claim by saying that although genetics does have an *influence* on our way of life but everything can't be explained through genetics. Culture is just as important.
- An example would be that people with the 9R/9R gene are less sexually active but if the subculture encourages sexual behaviors, then the gene could be overrode. Another example is the DRD2 gene which makes people abuse alcohol - what if a person has this gene in a Muslim country where alcohol is banned?

### Culture and Technology

- **Technology**: tools, skills or procedures necessary to make and use those tools.
- Technology is central to a group's material culture.

#### The New Technology

- People make technology all the time but most of the time it has very little impact. Sometimes, it has a huge impact on human lives e.g. the printing press, factories, assembly line, microchips, etc.
- This emerging technology is known as **new technology**.
- *However, this new technology sets the framework for a group's non-material culture as well.*

#### Cultural Lag and Cultural Change

- William Ogburn (1922/1950) coined the term **Cultural Lag**.
- Ogburn meant that not all parts of a culture change at the same pace.
- When one part of a culture changes, other parts lag behind.
- Ogburn pointed out that a group’s material culture usually changes first, with the nonmaterial culture lagging behind.
- A good example is that the school year is just 9 months long with a huge summer break. Why does the summer break exist? In the 1800s, children had to help out in family farms during the summers so they had to take breaks. However, farming is mostly automated now so these summer breaks are not required but it is part of our nonmaterial culture. As a result, we are lagging behind when it comes to summer breaks.

#### Technology and Cultural Leveling

- For most of human history, communication was limited and travel was slow. Consequently, people developed unique cultures according to their environment.
- When people *did* contact one another, they learned from each other and adopted cultural traits they deemed desirable.
- **Cultural Diffusion**: the spread of cultural traits from one group to another; includes both material and non-material cultural traits.
- With today’s trade, travel, and communications, cultural diffusion is occurring rapidly. Travel and communication bridge time and space to such an extent that there is
almost no “other side of the world” anymore. As a result, cultural leveling is happening - basically all cultures are coming on the same level.
- **Cultural Leveling**: the process by which cultures become similar to one another; refers especially to the process by which Western culture is being exported and diffused into other nations.
