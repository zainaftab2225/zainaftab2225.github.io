### Introduction

Emile Durkheim (1858-1917) was a French sociologist who had two major professional goals:
1. To get sociology recognized as a separate discipline;
2. To show how social forces affect peoples behaviors.

He achieved this goal in 1887 when the University of Bordeaux awarded him the world’s first academic appointment in sociology. To accomplish his second goal, Durkheim conducted rigorous research about the suicide rates of European countries. He found a pattern that every country had a stable suicide rate year after year. He also found that males, Protestants and the unmarried are more likely to commit suicide. He concluded that members of these groups lack **social integration** and have fewer social bonds as they are comparatively more independent than the rest. Although many years have passed since Durkheim's research, the principle he uncovered about suicide rates still apply to modern society.

The central idea behind Durkheim's research was that *"human behavior is not restricted to the individual, the social forces surrounding the individual also affect their behavior"*. For example, suicide may seem like a personal problem of an individual that needs to be studied by psychologists. However, suicide patterns studied by sociologists are largely consistent over time suggesting that the problem is not just confined to the individual but rather to the whole society.

### Society and Social Facts

Durkheim realized that society is more than the individual who compose it. It was present before us, it shapes our lifestyle and it will remain after we pass on. Patterns of human behavior - cultural norms, values, beliefs - which influence the individual are known as **social facts**. In other words, social facts are anything in society that puts external pressure on a member of society to act in a certain way. As society is bigger than us, it has the power to guide our thoughts and actions. Some examples are:
- A classroom of college students taking a math exam;
- A family gathered around a table sharing a meal;
- People quietly waiting their turn in a doctor’s office;
- The different music people listen to in different parts of the world.

### Durkheim and Structural Functionalism

Durkheim also talked about the concept of **function**. Society should be analyzed and described in terms of functions. Society is a system of interrelated parts where no one part can function without the other. These parts make up the whole of society. If one part changes, it has an impact on society as a whole. Functionalism emphasizes a societal equilibrium. Based on Durkheim's perspective, some examples are:
- The state provides public education for children. The family of the children pays taxes, which the state uses for public education. The children who learn from public education go on to become law-abiding and working citizens, who pay taxes to support the state. If any of these functions are disrupted, then the society as a whole will be affected;
- Crime and delinquent behavior also helps promote stability in the society as it leads to a reaction from the victims. If there are enough reactions from the members of the society, this leads to a common consensus that a certain action is considered harmful. Thus, it is considered morally wrong and a law is established against it resulting in stability. Durkheim concluded that crime is "normal" for the basic of reasons: A society could not exist without it.
