- Women's historian, Mary Ritter, asserts that in 2500 years of written history, male writers overlooked the histories of females.
- The history of mankind has been dominated by the political, economic and military exploits of an elite, powerful group of men.
- Today, women's history accounts for the race, class and gender.

## Neolithic and Early Bronze Age

- Archaeological evidence suggests that during the Neolithic and Bronze age, there may have been:
  - a matrilineal system.
  - female creator images.
  - powerful queens.
  - sexual freedom of women.
- Some historians suggest that these ancient societies were neither based on patriarchy or matriarchy. The assert that it was rather an egalitarian society based on partnerships between the two sexes. Basically, there was **no stratification based on gender**.
- Over time, this system was replaced by a patrilineal system where images of goddesses were replaced by images of gods.

## Early Greece (700-323 BCE)

### Greek Literature

- Greek literature is filled with references to the matriarchal society of the **Amazons**.
- Greek mythology saw the Amazons as female warriors with little need of men except as sexual partners.
- Notable queens of the Amazons in Greek mythology are:
  1. Otrera (wife of Ares, God of War)
  2. Penthesilea (daughter of Ares, God of War)
  3. Hippolyta (daughter of Ares, God of War)
- The Greek society revered women when it came to religion but saw women as inferior in political, social and legal areas.  

### Views of Greek Philosophers

**Plato:**
  - He called for women education as he thought a superior woman is better than an inferior man.
  - He championed that women should be involved in democracy. However, he stated that as women are uneducated, they are unfit for democracy.
  - Women were also excluded from his academy and dialogues.

**Aristotle:**
  - Aristotle is more representative of the general view of how Greek society saw women.
  - Aristotle said that a husband should rule over his wife and children just as free men rule over slaves.

### Women in Athens

- The writings of Plato and Aristotle influenced the Greek society to relegate women to an inferior social status.
- Husbands and male kin held the power of life and death over women.
- Childbearing responsibilities could be transferred from a mother to a concubine, further lowering a wife's subordinate status.
- Athenian society did not tolerate women in public places except for funerals and all-female festivals.
- The subordinate position of Athenian women extended to most of the Greek world except Sparta.

### Women in Sparta

- Young unmarried women enjoyed a high degree of freedom but were still subordinate to the male family members.
- Women were trained to be physically fit and manage households independently when the men were out at war.

## Early Rome (509â€“280 BCE)

- In early Roman societies, men held all the authority. The families were known as **pater families**.
- Women did have some freedom though. They could participate in:
  - inheritance.
  - common economic activities.
- The roman poet, **Juvenal**, warned men that women are dangerous and distracting.

## Middle Ages (400-1400 CE)

- Christianity enveloped Europe during the Middle Ages which was misogynistic. The most notable misogyny occurred with the **witch burning**.
- It was a brutal period of time for women because:
  - they were labeled as witches.
  - they were hunted down and burned alive.
  - they were economically dependent on men.
- Thousands of women were burned as witches to "appease God's anger".

## The Renaissance (1300-1600 CE)

- The Renaissance was an era of change which naturally extended to women.
- It had positive effects on women of all social standing. Some examples are:
  - Women became patrons of literature and art.
  - Many women became authors, scientists, writers, etc.
- Martin Luther advocated opening Christianity to everyone, even women. He introduced the idea of Protestantism. He believed that women were also made by God and will be judged on the basis of their faith.
- Many women accepted Christianity and Protestantism because of these inclusive views. However, some women paid a heavy price who dared to criticize the Catholic church. They were tortured and executed.
- Even though Martin Luther was inclusive of women when it came to religion, he still thought women were not equal to men.
