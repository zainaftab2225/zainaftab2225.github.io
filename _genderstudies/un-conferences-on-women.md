## Introduction

- UN took gender concerns and women rights since its inception.
- The member states of UN were 51 in 1951, Out of 51 only 13 allowed women to right of equal vote and right to hold public office.
- In June 1946, the **United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)** established the **Commission on the Status of Women (CSW)** to ensure:
  - the empowerment of women and gender equality
  - to provide recommendations to the Council on the obstacles relating women’s rights in political, economic, civil, social and education fields.
- Over the years, the CSW has organized different conferences in order to assert and improve the rights of women.
- So far, four world conferences on women have taken place:
  1. Mexico (1975)
  2. Copenhagen (1980)
  3. Nairobi (1985)
  4. Beijing (1995)

## First World Conference - A Global Dialogue (1975)

- The first world conference on the status of women was convened in Mexico City to coincide with the 1975 International Women's Year.
- The objective was to remind the international community that discrimination against women continued to be a persistent problem in much of the world.
- The Mexico City Conference was called for by the United Nations General Assembly to **focus international attention on the need to develop future oriented goals, effective strategies and plans of action for the advancement of women**.
- It was the largest international forum in which women themselves participated. Out of 133 states, 130 were headed by women.
- It was stressed on countries to make policies for women. Eastern states were more concerned on peace but western states were more concerned on the role of women in development.

- **Major Concerns and Issues:**
  - Discrimination against Women
  - Ensuring full Gender Equality
  - Participation of Women in Development
  - Social and Economic Integration for Women
  - Increased Contribution of Women in Global Peace
- UN also established two new divisions after the conference:
  1. INSTRAW (International Research And Training Institute for The Advancement of Women)
  2. UNIFEM (United Nation Development Fund for Women)

## Second World Conference -  The Review Process (1980)

- There was a general consensus that significant progress had been made as representatives of 145 Member States met in Copenhagen in 1980 for the second world conference on women to review and appraise the 1975 World Plan of Action.
- An important milestone had been the adopted by the General Assembly in December 1979: **Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women**, one of the most powerful instruments for women's equality.
  - It is been called the **'bill of rights of women'**.
  - 165 states were obligated to report within one year of ratification, and subsequently every four years, on the steps they have taken to remove obstacles they face in implementing the Convention.
  - An **optional protocol** to the Convention enabled women victims of sex discrimination to submit complaints to an international treaty body.
- **CEDAW Major Concerns:**
  - Involvement of men in improving women’s role in society
  - Political participation and rights for women

  - Women in decision making
  - Extending the facility and services related to women at national level
  - Day care services
  - Credit services
  - Provision of financial services of women

- Despite the progress made, the Copenhagen Conference recognized that signs of disparity were beginning to emerge between rights secured and women's ability to exercise these rights.
