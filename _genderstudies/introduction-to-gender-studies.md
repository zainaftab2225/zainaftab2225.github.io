## Gender

- Originally 'gender' is a grammatical term borrowed from linguistics; it is the collective term for the categories of **masculine**, **feminine** or **neuter**.
- A given culture associates certain *attitudes*, *feelings** and *behaviors* with a certain sex - this is called **gender**. The cultural basically expects a person to behave according to the gender (social role) assigned to them. If that behavior is compatible, it is called **gender-normative**. If that behavior is incompatible, it is called **gender non-conformity**.
- At first, the gendered roles in society were assumed to be the natural result of one’s sex. However, cross-cultural studies demonstrate that while **sex is a universal condition; gender roles vary across culture**.
- **Significance of Gender**: Our society is filled with problems like gender subordination and gender discrimination. So if gender is a social construct, then change is possible and these problems can be addressed.

### Difference between Sex and Gender

- **Sex** refers to a person’s biological and physiological status. It is typically categorized as male, female or intersex. There are a number of indicators of biological sex:
  - Chromosomes
  - Gonads
  - Internal reproductive organs
  - External genitalia
  - Secondary sex characteristics

- **Gender** refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.
- Gender emphasizes that masculinity and femininity are products of social, cultural and psychological factors and are acquired by an individual in the process of becoming a man or woman. Hence, gender is a product of socialization rather than being something that is natural.

|------- | ---------|

| It is a universal term  | It is variable as it changes under the influence of time, geographical and socio-cultural settings  |
| It is biological | It is social |
