## Gender

- Originally 'gender' is a grammatical term borrowed from linguistics; it is the collective term for the categories of **masculine**, **feminine** or **neuter**.
- A given culture associates certain *attitudes*, *feelings* and *behaviors* with a certain sex - this is called **gender**. The cultural basically expects a person to behave according to the gender (social role) assigned to them. If that behavior is compatible, it is called **gender-normative**. If that behavior is incompatible, it is called **gender non-conformity**.
- At first, the gendered roles in society were assumed to be the natural result of one’s sex. However, cross-cultural studies demonstrate that while **sex is a universal condition; gender roles vary across culture**.
- **Significance of Gender**: Our society is filled with problems like gender subordination and gender discrimination. So if gender is a social construct, then change is possible and these problems can be addressed.

### Difference between Sex and Gender

- **Sex** refers to a person’s biological and physiological status. It is typically categorized as male, female or intersex. There are a number of indicators of biological sex:
  - Chromosomes
  - Gonads
  - Internal reproductive organs
  - External genitalia
  - Secondary sex characteristics

- **Gender** refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.
- Gender emphasizes that masculinity and femininity are products of social, cultural and psychological factors and are acquired by an individual in the process of becoming a man or woman. Hence, gender is a product of socialization rather than being something that is natural.
- John Money, a psychologist, distinguished between:
  1. **Sexual Identity**: the physical identity at birth.
  2. **Gender Identity**: the self-consciousness of one's own gender.
  3. **Gender Role**: the public expression of gender identity.

| Sex | Gender |

| It is natural | It is a social construct  |
| It is a universal term  | It is variable as it changes under the influence of time, geographical and socio-cultural settings  |
| It is biological | It is social |


## Introduction to Gender Studies

### Definition

- Gender studies investigates the biological differences between men and women but focuses on these differences in a **socio-cultural context**.
- It is a remarkable discriminating tool in the distribution of labor, care, possession, income, education, organizational qualities or diseases. Hence, it is important to study gender.

### Understanding Gender Studies

- Some questions asked by the discipline of gender studies:
  1. How do stereotypical models of men and women develop?
  2. How do they change over time, and what factors contribute to changes?
  3. What impact do such stereotypes have upon actually existing men and women?
- Men and women do not exist in isolation from their other social roles and positions. A woman also has a caste, class, creed, religious identity, etc. All these aspects are a part of her life. They need to be studied with respect to gender. Does gender have a influence on these aspects or not?


### History and Evolution

- At first, the concept of 'gender studies' did not exist. The subject emerged as women studies due to the lack of knowledge and interest in women. It was considered necessary to study the situation of women and fill knowledge gaps.
- The first women's studies course was apparently created by American historian Mary Ritter Beard, who in 1934 constructed a course titled "A Changing Political Economy as it Affects Women". It was never taught but it did lay down the foundations for women as a subject of academia.
- Women’s studies, as an area of academic study, came into being during the emergence of feminism’s second wave:
  - First Women's Studies program in San Diego State University, USA (1970).
  - MA in women’s studies was offered at the University of Kent, UK (1980).
  - India established vigorous Women’s Studies research in the early 1970s.
- Some twenty years later, more than 600 such programs existed, including both undergraduate and graduate programs.
- A number of disciplines across the social sciences, the arts and humanities began to pay increasing attention to gender after the second wave of feminism. Before that, these disciplines largely ignored gender.
- Western intellectuals and male critics called this emerging discipline a fad that will die down with time and it had no intellectual merit.
- In the US, the first accredited Women's Studies course was held in 1960 at the University of Kansas. The first two Women's Studies Programs in the United States were established
in 1970 at San Diego State College. As of 2012, there are 16 institutions offering a Ph.D. in Women's Studies in the United States.
- Presently, Women’s studies is engaged in a heated debate over the move to eliminate the term women studies and replace it with gender studies.
  - The change to gender studies suggests that the field needs to be paying attention to the relationships between men and women rather than focusing predominantly on women’s experiences and knowledge itself.
  - The main argument against the change to Gender Studies is the claim that this shift will undo the past forty years in bringing women and women’s standpoints to the forefront in research, knowledge, and cultural production.
