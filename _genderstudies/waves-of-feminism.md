## introduction

- Feminism is a movement **"of women, by women, and for women"** to achieve women's rights.
- Feminism stands for:
  1. Gender Equality
  2. Independence of Women
  3. Empowerment of Women
- Feminism combined "femme", French for woman, with the suffix "ism" meaning woman's political position.
- **Mary Wollstonecraft** and **Jane Austen** are foremothers of the modern women's movement.
- Organized women movements started in the late 19th century and are categorized in three time periods:
  1. First Wave of Feminism
  2. Second Wave of Feminism
  3. Third Wave of Feminism
- **Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper (1892)"** highlights the depression women experience when they are relegated to the home. The wallpaper in the house becomes a metaphor for the way the home stifles women's creativity and actualization. **Betty Friedan**, an American feminist writer, called it **"the problem with no name"**.

## First Wave of Feminism (1848-1920)

- Journalist **Marsha Lear of the New York Times** coined the term "first wave of feminism" retroactively in 1968 along with the term "second wave of feminism".


- The first wave of feminism started around 1848.
- This wave was mainly focused on:
  1. **The right to vote**
  2. Education
  3. Employment
  4. Marriage laws (divorce and child custody)
  5. Property rights
  6. Healthcare
- The primary gains of this were:
  1. **The right to vote**
  2. Right to practice birth control
- Feminists state that the first wave started with Mary Wollstonecraft's book, **"A Vindication of the Rights of Women (1792)"** which advocated women education. Wollstonecraft has been called the first feminist because of this.
- The first wave of feminism sprouted up alongside the **abolition and temperance movements** during a time of great social change.
- White women who opposed the institution of slavery soon realized they were facing the same inequalities under the racist, sexist and classist system of government in the United States.
- **Elizabeth Cady Stanton** and **Lucretia Mott** travelled to the **first World Anti-Slavery Convention in London in 1840** but the organizers refused to allow them to participate being women.
- This led to them organizing their own convention which was the Seneca Falls Convention 1848.

### Seneca Falls Convention (1848)

- Elizabeth Cady and Mott were **Quakers**, a Christian group which advocated against slavery and gender equality. In Quaker sermons, even women were allowed to preach.
- They organized the **Seneca Falls Convention** in New York in July 1848.
- The convention demanded equal rights for men and women.
- Elizabeth Cady read the **Declaration of Sentiments** modeled after the Declaration of Independence: "All men and women are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."
- The Declaration of Sentiments objected to the following:
  - Women were not allowed to vote.
  - Married women had no property rights.
  - Husbands had legal power over their wives; they could even beat them with impunity.
  - Divorce and child custody favored men.
  - Women were not allowed to enter professions such as medicine and law.
- Over 200 people signed the document including some infamous names like **Frederick Douglass**, a former slave turned into a prominent figure of the abolitionist movement.

### Birth Control Movement (1919)

- The birth control movement was started by a public health nurse, **Margaret Sanger**.
- In 1916, Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the United States, which led to her arrest.
- Her subsequent trial and appeal generated controversy. Sanger felt that in order for women to have a more equal footing in society and to lead healthier lives, they needed to be able to determine when to bear children.
- In 1921, Sanger founded the **American Birth Control League**, which later became the **Planned Parenthood Federation of America**.
- It was not until 1965 that women could obtain contraceptives legally.
- **Roe v. Wade (1973)** was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects a pregnant woman's liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction.

### The 19th Amendment (1920)

- First wave of feminists were led by suffragists such as:
  1. Susan B. Anthony
  2. Margaret Sanger
  3. Anna Shaw
  4. Elizabeth Cady Stanton
- These women succeeded in 1920 with the passage of the 19th amendment of the US Constitution.
- In 1893, New Zealand had granted the right to vote to women but they could not become members of the parliament.
- In 1902, Australia was the first country in the world where all women got the vote and could become members of the parliament.
