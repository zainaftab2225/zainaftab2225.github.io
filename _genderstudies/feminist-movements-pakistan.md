### Background

- In Pakistan, the women movement has been vibrant due to issues like:
  - gender violence
  - gender discrimination
  - women's right to life, health and education
- Women in Pakistan face a lot of gender prejudice due to a **male dominated society, tribal systems, religious interpretations and feudal mindset**.

### Evolution

- The history of activism for women rights in Pakistan as its roots in the colonial era of nineteenth century as they faced extreme discrimination in matters of education, basic rights, etc.
- Post-independence, women were given several rights:
  1. right to vote
  2. right to participate in elections
  3. right of inheritance
-  The **Zia era** had a defining impact on the working dynamics of women’s movement. The connection between violence against women and human rights became clear in context of the oppressive laws that were responsible for increased violence and constant new proposals to terminate women rights and curtail their spaces.
- Women were among the first articulating public opposition to the Marshall Law regimes and civil society activism in the early 1980’s was driven by these women activists who were among the founders of the human rights commission of Pakistan.
- Through the passage of time, with the help of activists, **numerous laws** were established for a better status for women:
  1. Dowry and Bridal Gift Restriction act (1976)
  2. Criminal Law Act (2004)
  3. Protection of Women Act (2006, revised the Hudood Ordinance)
  4. Protection of Harassment of Women at Work Place (2010)
  5. Prevention of Anti-Women Practices Act (2011)
  6. Domestic Violence Act (2012)
  7. Enforcement of Women Ownership Rights Act (2012)
- In spite of all these mentioned and numerous other laws, women still face discrimination.
- The women movement in Pakistan mainly consists of upper and middle class urban and educated professional of women activists. They have been criticized as an elite group of westernized women who are out of touch with the problems facing the majority of Pakistani women.
- Only a small number of women could benefit the laws and policies established. For majority of women their boundaries and limitations are still shaped by the domestic environment.
