## Origins of Humans and Early Human Societies

### History and Prehistory

- Modern human beings have existed for about 200,000 years.
- *Writing* was invented about 5000 years ago.
- History before writing is known as **prehistory**.
- We need to take history with a grain of salt as the writers might have added embellishments.
- **Anthropology:** The study of human and past human societies.
- **Archaeology:** A subset of anthropology that focuses on past human societies.
- **Paleontology:** The branch of science concerned with fossil animals and plants.
- Scientists use techniques like **radiocarbon dating** and **potassium-argon dating** to estimate the age of past objects.


### Homo Sapiens and Early Human Migration

- **Homo Sapiens** is part of a group called hominids, which were the earliest humanlike creatures.
- Though there were once many kinds of hominids, only one remains: Homo Sapiens.
- Hominid family shared the trait of **bipedalism**: the ability to walk upright on two legs.

- The **Aridity/Savannah Hypothesis** states that a climate event took place which removed a lot of the trees forcing the hominids to walk on the ground.
- Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens began migrating from the African continent and populating parts of Europe and Asia.
- The development of *language* around 50,000 years ago allowed people to make plans, solve problems, and organize effectively to even travel.
- When humans migrated from Africa to colder climates, they made clothing out of animal skins and constructed fires to keep themselves warm.
- Humans began to use the earth’s resources in new ways when they constructed semi-permanent settlements.
