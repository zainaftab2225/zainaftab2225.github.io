### Printing

- Output any expression to the screen using the **print()** function.

```python
print("Hello World") # Hello World
print("The answer of 2+2 is: ", 2+2) # The answer of 2+2 is: 4
print("The answer of 2+2 is: ", "2+2") # The answer is: 2+2
```

- To output double quotes within the text, use **\"**. This is called an *escape code*.

```python

print("Hello \" World ") # Hello " World

```

- Some other important escape codes are listed in the table below.

| Escape Code | Description |
|------- | ---------|
| \' | Single Quote |
| \" | Double Quote |
| \t | Tab |
| \r | Carriage Return |
| \n | Linefeed/New Line |
