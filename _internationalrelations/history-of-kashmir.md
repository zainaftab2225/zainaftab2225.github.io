## Early History-1949

### Background

- Kashmir had secured the right to self-govern by paying a tribute to the British in the past.
- When the British left, 550 Princely States including Kashmir had to make a decision. Kashmir could become independent or join either India or Pakistan.
- Due to the contiguous geography and demography of Kashmir, Jinnah was convinced that Kashmir will join Pakistan. Unfortunately, it was a naive misjudgement of huge proportions.

### The Maharaja

- Maharaja Hari Singh, the autocratic ruler of Kashmir, was an aristocrat whose main interests were food, hunting, sex and horse racing. He showed a lack of judgement in matters of state.
- He was a Hindu but he ruled over a multi-ethnic state where Muslims were in majority.
- The area of his rule included:
  1. Jammu (Hindu majority)
  2. Ladakh (Buddhist majority)
  3. Gilgit-Baltistan (Muslim majority)
  4. Kashmir Valley (Muslim majority)
- In 1941, it was reported that the Muslims were in a bad condition: they were poor, illiterate and had little contact with the aristocrats. The maharaja himself hardly ever met his Muslim subjects.
- - As the British prepared to leave, it was clear the maharaja wanted independence.

### The British

- The maharaja faced the opposition of Jinnah, Nehru and the British. Lord Louis Mountbatten made special efforts to make sure Kashmir did not opt for autonomy: he set aside six days for a visit to the maharaja's summer capital, Srinagar.
- Pakistani historians believe that Mountbatten convinced the maharaja to join Delhi. Indian counterparts believe that the viceroy behaved appropriately and only gave advice to the maharaja. Nonetheless, the actual discussions that took place in Srinagar will never be known.
- There are also controversies that Lord Mountbatten had influenced Sir Cyril Radcliffe, the person who was charged with drawing the border of India and Pakistan. Sir Cyril Radcliffe had never set foot in India so his commission (Boundary Commission) was to be completely impartial. There are documents of Sir Cyril Radcliffe that initially gave Ferozepor to Pakistan but was later changed after a meeting with Lord Mountbatten. Even Indian historians have accepted this fact. Nevertheless, there was no conclusive evidence for Mountbatten's advocacy for Kashmir to be a part of India.
- Lord Mountbatten did advocate a referendum or a plebiscite in Kashmir. He stated that even if the maharaja acceded to India, it would only be temporary. The real decision of Kashmir would be taken by its people.

### India's Strategy

- The Muslim League leadership had their hands full due to the creation of a new state. There were barely any visits to Kashmir by the Pakistani leadership.
- On the other hand, the Indian counterparts established their interest in Kashmir. Nehru had toured Kashmir in 1945 and had addressed a National Conference rally. He visited again in 1946.
- The Congress lobbying effort in Kashmir meant that if there was to be an accession, the maharaja would opt for India and not Pakistan.

### The Poonch Uprising

- Once the British left, the state of Kashmir started disintegrating. There was communal violence, many Muslims fled to Pakistan and many Hindus fled to India.
- The situation was very dire in Poonch were the most troublesome Muslim subjects existed. They were ordered by the maharaja to give away their weapons which sparked an uprising in September 1947.
- Jinnah hoped that the uprising might force the maharaja to opt for Pakistan. Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan drew up plans to help the rebels and to not directly intervene in Kashmir: a policy Pakistan has continued for a long time.
- The effort to support the rebels was small-scale but the maharaja was offended that Pakistan was backing the rebels. He didn't even meet envoys from Karachi during the rebellion.
- In October, tribesmen from NWFP started entering Kashmir to relieve it from the maharaja. This was, again, supported by the Pakistani government. Some say that Jinnah did not know about this, the constitutionally-minded, upright and law-abiding Jinnah could have very well not known about this.
- At first, the tribesmen enjoyed success against the maharaja's forces but then they got distracted and started pillaging the villages. These developments gave bad press to Pakistan.
- The maharaja signed the accession to India to stop these uprisings and rebellions and Indian troops were deployed. However, it is not clear whether the troops were deployed first or the accession was signed first. 

### Jinnah's Failure

- Jinnah was a brilliant man with a combination of talents when it came to constitution and law. However, there was a multitude of reasons why Kashmir became his failure. Some are given below:
  - Jinnah was sick.
  - His administration skills were not as effective as his law-making.
  - He had a plethora of problems such as the refugee crisis.
  - The armed forces of Pakistan largely had British soldiers which did not want to fight the Indian troops (also British).
- Jinnah also failed to compromise over another Princely State, Hyderabad. He was an idealist and hoped that Hyderabad would remain independent by making a political decision. However, Delhi deployed troops and took over Hyderabad.
- Junagadh was a completely opposite mirror of Kashmir. However, the Indian forces blockaded Junagadh, invaded it and held a flimsy plebiscite: Junagadh became part of India.
- Even the US State Department had hoped that a compromise on Kashmir would be reached, "the obvious solution is for the government leaders in Pakistan and India to agree...[to the] accession of Kashmir to Pakistan and the accession of Hyderabad and Junagadh to India." British officials in London concurred. Jinnah, however, never did the deal and the fighting continued.
- By the end of the year, Delhi controlled about two-thirds of Kashmir and Karachi about one-third. On 1 January 1949, a ceasefire came into effect in Kashmir.
